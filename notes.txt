1)why img_size = 32 in image select (is it for centering image?)
		
2)why x * PIXELS + img_size / 2, y * PIXELS + img_size / 2 in the follwoing code
if (mlx_image_to_window(data->mlx, data->img->rupee,
				x * PIXELS + img_size / 2, y * PIXELS + img_size / 2) < 0)
			error_message("Failed to put image to window");

3) check resizing

4) why we dont free textures here
void	load_player_textures(t_game *game)
{
	game->player_up = mlx_load_png("./sprites/Player_Up.png");
	if (!game->player_up)
		write_error("Error while loading png");
	game->player_down = mlx_load_png("./sprites/Player_Down.png");
	if (!game->player_down)
		write_error("Error while loading png");
	game->player_left = mlx_load_png("./sprites/Player_Left.png");
	if (!game->player_left)
		write_error("Error while loading png");
	game->player_right = mlx_load_png("./sprites/Player_Right.png");
	if (!game->player_right)
		write_error("Error while loading png");
}
